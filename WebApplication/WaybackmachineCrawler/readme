This is a special script made for crawling and sorting waybackmachine lists for penetration testing purposes. 
 
It will give out three files :
{domain}all.txt  ==> Contains all the fetched urls.
{domain}subs.txt ==> Contains all the subdomains of the requested domain.
{domain}ext.txt  ==> Contains all the urls that have extensions.

To run the script run the Mainln.py {domain}.
waybach.py works same way as the main script separately as well if you want all the urls for the specified domain without any sorting or output.
